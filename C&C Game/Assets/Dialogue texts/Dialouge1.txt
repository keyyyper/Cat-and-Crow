Miss Millie: Oh hello there Candle, Clover, how lovely to see you both in town! Where’s Hazel? 

Candle: The old hag forgot us again.

Clover: Language Candle! My apologies Miss Millie; might you know how to leave town from here? Last I heard the humans closed the gates due to the slime infestation.

Miss Millie: Oh dearie me! That is certainly troublesome for the two of you isn’t it. Hmm. Perhaps Pirate Sam knows where a spare Key might be, he does enjoy collecting his shiny trinkets.

Candle: Oh you mean that delusional bird? He hangs out by the dock to the west right? 

Miss Millie: That’s the one! 

Clover: Thank you kindly for your assistance Lady Millie, we’ll be off now! Come hither now Candle, move those legs of yours.

Candle: . . .

Candle: You know you can walk right?

Clover: And dust up my feathers? Preposterous!
